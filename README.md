# Water_Potability_Detection
This project uses Python and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict water potability based on quality parameters. By analyzing features like pH, hardness, and contaminants, the model classifies water samples as potable or non-potable, providing a quick and effective tool for water quality assessment.
